# Tic Tac Toe Enhancements

A creative twist of a tictactoe game implemented in Flutter that uses outer space characters with eye-catching animations instead of the traditional X and O.

## Features

- Single-player mode with **easy**, **medium**, and **hard** AI opponents.
- Animated winning cells and responsive layout.
- Scoreboard tracking wins, losses, and draws.
- Undo the last move or reset the board at any time.
- Works on mobile and desktop platforms.
